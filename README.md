# playmidi

Play MIDI files from the command line on macOS. Supports CoreMIDI devices.

## Howto

1. `git clone <repo-url>`
2. `cd /path/to/repo/`
3. `make`
4. `./playmidi <file> [<device-number>]` (If you do not provide a device number, the built-in software synthesizer will be used.)

## Swift version

The Swift version has a slightly different syntax, and is built with Xcode. Run `playmidi-swift --help` after building it for more information.
